# Clinic Management System
# Project Overview

This Clinic Management System is designed to efficiently handle all essential operations in a clinic. It stores and manages patient records, appointments, doctor information, and other clinic-related data using a structured SQL database. The system allows users to easily create, read, update, and delete information through SQL scripts, ensuring organized data storage, consistency, and easy retrieval. It also includes sample queries and triggers to demonstrate basic database functionalities, making it suitable for both learning purposes and practical clinic management.

# Web-based Clinic Management System

 we implemented a web-based version of the Clinic Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This version replicates the functionality of the original Python Tkinter application.

# Features:

Tabbed interface for easy navigation between Patients, Doctors, Clinics, and Appointments.

CRUD operations for each entity (Add, View, Update, Delete).

Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile screens.

Local Storage used to save data directly in the browser, so no external database is required.

Form validation and error handling to ensure correct data entry.

# Purpose:

This bonus implementation demonstrates:

How the system can be extended to a web application.

Ability to read and write data from a UI, fulfilling the bonus requirement.

A modern, interactive interface for clinic management.

# Repository Structure

/sql/ -> SQL scripts:
- create_tables.sql
- load_data.sql
