# Clinic Management System
# Project Overview

#This Clinic Management System is designed to efficiently handle all essential operations in a clinic. It stores and manages patient records, appointments, doctor information, and other clinic-related data using a structured SQL database. The system allows users to easily create, read, update, and delete information through SQL scripts, ensuring organized data storage, consistency, and easy retrieval. It also includes sample queries and triggers to demonstrate basic database functionalities, making it suitable for both learning purposes and practical clinic management.
